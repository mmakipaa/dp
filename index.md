Jupyter notebooks illustrating basic Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms using a simple maze or grid-world as an environment.

HTML versions of the notebooks rendered using [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) can be viewed by following the links below. These pre-rendered versions use a slightly larger font and fix an issue when applying styling using \<span\> -elements within markdown cells. Deep linking between notebooks works as well.

Links to notebooks rendered using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) also provided as an alternative. 

## Value Iteration

A notebook demonstrating value iteration algorithm. In addition, the notebook also covers some background of dynamic programming, briefly discussing for example Markov Decision Processes, policies and value functions.
