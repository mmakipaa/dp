# Basic Dynamic Programming Algorithms

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks illustrating basic Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms using a simple maze or grid-world as an environment.

In addition to Jupyter notebooks, html files rendered using [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) can be found in [html](html) folder. Prerendered versions use a slightly larger font and fix an issue when applying styling span elements within markdown cells.

## Value Iteration

A notebook illustrating Value Iteration algorithm. In addition. the notebook also covers some background of dynamic programming, briefly discussing for example Markov Decision Processes, policies and value functions.

## Basic Maze

A notebook containing the implementation for a basic maze, as well as utility functions for visualizing the maze. The implementation is imported by the notebooks above
